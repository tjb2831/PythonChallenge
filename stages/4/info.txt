URL:
   www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.html
      
      which tells us to change to
   
   www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.php

Description:
   The picture shows a seasaw toy, but the image looks clickable!
   Clicking brings us to a new page with the URL:

      http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.php?nothing=12345

   and the text

      "and the next nothing is 44827"

   When I replace the old nothing with the new nothing in the URL,
   I get a similar page with a new, third nothing. And again gives
   another new nothing...

Hint:
   <No hint>

Impression:
   Clearly we need to keep following the trail of 'nothings',
   but the trail is too long to do it by hand. We need a way
   to walk through the list programmatically.

   From the looks of the page source, PyCurl and regex 
   seem like a good starting point.
