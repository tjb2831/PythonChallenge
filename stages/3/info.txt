Description:
   One little candle with three large candles on both sides

Hint:
   One small letter, surrounded by EXACTLY three big bodyguards
   on each of its sides

Impression:
   Sounds like a regular expression match. Likely we need to find
   the one lower case letter that has exactly three upper case
   letter to its left and right. But where? Let's look at the page
   source again... Oh. There it is..
