This solution is very similar to the previous stage.

PyCurl is used to grab the source code. The re module is
used to isolate the comment block in which to search,
and again to search for the solution.

For this stage, we are searching for one lower case
letter, surrounded by exactly three upper case
letters. A first attempt used the following regex:

   [A-Z]{3}([a-z])[A-Z]{3}

This will search for 3 upper case letters, one lower
case letter, and three upper case letters in a row. This
almost works, but the following (incorrect) strings will
match:

   AAAAbCCC
   DDDeFFFF

The {n} qualifier matches as long as there are at least
n matches; not if there are exactly n matches.

To fix this, we can add the stipulation that there
cannot be any upper case letters before or after
the match.

   [^A-Z][A-Z]{3}([a-z])[A-Z]{3}[^A-Z]

Applying this regex on the search block yields the
correct solution.
