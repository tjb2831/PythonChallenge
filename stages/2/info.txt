Description:
   The image is simply an open book. But the hint...

Hint:
   recognize [sic] the characters. maybe [sic] they are in the book, but
   MAYBE they are in the page source.

Impression:
   Clearly we need to look at the HTML source code for this stage (the page
   source).

   After the closing <html> tag for the page, there is a comment that reads
   "find teh rare characters in the mess below:". Below that is a massive
   (the 'mess'). The mess contains many duplicated, non-sensical characters.
   There are a lot of different braces, punctuation, and dollar signs, among
   other meaningless characters.

   Since we're supposed to look for 'rare' characters, there must be some
   in the mess that appear infrequently. Lets sift through the mess for
   characters that appear once and see if it makes a useful result!
