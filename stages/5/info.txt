Description:
   An image of a hill

Hint:
   pronounce it

Impression:
   Looking at the page source, there is an html tag
      <peakhell src="banner.p"/>
   and a comment
      <!-- peak hell sounds familiar ? -->

   Clicking on the "banner.p" link brings leads to seemingly gibberish data.
   But peak hell sounds a lot like 'pickle'...
