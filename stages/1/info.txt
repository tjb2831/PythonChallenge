Description:
   A piece of paper is shown with the following text
      K -> M
      O -> Q
      E -> G

   Under the image of the paper is some (seemingly) gibberish

Hint:
   Everybody thinks twice before solving this.

Impression:
   The letters (and the not so subtle URL) implies the 3 letters on the left map
   to the letters on the right. The difference between the pairs is 2 position
   right shift along the alphabet.

   The 'gibberish' under the image is likely cipher text created using a Ceaser
   Cipher, left shifted by two (the decryption right shifts by 2, so the
   encryption goes in the opposite direction)
